# Data-Visualization
This created page allows for the viewing of uploaded data. Four different scatter plots display the values of data points for eight different variables simultaneously. Users can alter the variables for each graph using the dropdown menus provided for each axis of each scatter plot. The dropdown menus for each graph solely contain numeric variables. Furthermore, the user can filter the data based on the values of a specific variable. A separate dropdown menu controls the filtering feature. The user can filter the data using an interactive slider for numeric variables. For categorical variables, the user will have the ability to select categories one at a time. Additionally, the user will have the ability to display all the ids of the data points plotted on the charts. <br/>
